// JPEG (JFIF/baseline sequential DCT) decoding -- NOT a port of any file in
// the original id Quake II source (vanilla ref_gl/ref_soft only ever load
// PCX/WAL/TGA; see gl_image.ts's own header comment). Added so the retail
// re-release's shipped .jpg assets load: baseq2/pak0.pak's images.c texture
// format probe chain is "png jpg tga" (images.c:2258 in the reference
// engine) and the pak ships 198 .jpg files (all under vault/ and
// vault/preview/ -- promotional artwork the in-game "vault" unlockable
// gallery displays), none of which have a .png or .tga sibling.
//
// SURVEY (this unit's own pass over all 198 shipped .jpg files, reading
// every file's SOF marker/precision/component/sampling-factor bytes
// directly out of baseq2/pak0.pak -- see the task report for the full
// listing): every single one is SOF0 (baseline sequential DCT), 8-bit
// precision, 3 components (YCbCr), no arithmetic coding, no restart
// markers (no DRI segment in any of them). Subsampling splits two ways:
// 184 files 4:2:0 (H=2,V=2 on the Y component), 14 files 4:4:4 (H=1,V=1
// on every component, all under vault/preview/ or vault/*.jpg full-size
// concept art) -- no 4:2:2 example exists in the shipped data. A
// baseline-only decoder was therefore sufficient for 100% of the real
// retail data, and progressive (SOF2) support was originally left
// unimplemented (reported as "unsupported", never misdecoded). It has
// since been added as a scoped follow-up (this file's SOF2 branch) so
// that non-retail progressive JPEGs (mod/tool-authored content, or future
// retail updates) decode correctly instead of hard-failing; the baseline
// (SOF0) decode path below is untouched by that follow-up. 4:2:2 and
// restart-marker support were also implemented beyond what the retail
// survey required (both are simple extensions of the same general
// subsampling-factor and entropy-alignment logic already needed for
// 4:2:0), since a decoder that only handles the exact subsampling ratios
// seen in one snapshot of one pak is needlessly brittle.
//
// Scope, matching png.ts's "narrow deliberately" precedent:
//   - SOF0 (baseline sequential DCT) and SOF2 (progressive DCT, Huffman
//     coding) are supported. SOF1 (extended sequential), SOF3/SOF7
//     (lossless), SOF5/SOF6 (differential sequential/progressive),
//     SOF9-SOF15 (arithmetic-coded variants) are recognized by marker
//     byte and reported as `{ ok: false, reason: "unsupported JPEG
//     variant: ..." }` -- never misdecoded as baseline or progressive.
//   - 8-bit sample precision only (SOF0/SOF2's precision byte); 12-bit is
//     recognized and reported unsupported, matching png.ts's bit-depth
//     check.
//   - 1 (grayscale) or 3 (YCbCr) component scans only; anything else
//     (e.g. 4-component CMYK/YCCK, seen in some Adobe-authored JPEGs but
//     never in the shipped retail data) reports unsupported. This applies
//     to SOF2 as well, even though the spec permits up to 4 components in
//     a progressive frame (Table B.2) -- CMYK/YCCK was out of scope for
//     the baseline decoder and stays out of scope here.
//   - Arbitrary integer H/V sampling factors (1-4) per component -- not
//     hardcoded to 4:2:0/4:2:2/4:4:4 specifically, so any legal baseline
//     or progressive subsampling ratio decodes correctly.
//   - Baseline (SOF0): a single interleaved scan (one SOS) is supported;
//     a second SOS (non-interleaved multi-scan baseline, legal but
//     vanishingly rare and absent from the retail data) reports
//     unsupported rather than being silently dropped.
//   - Progressive (SOF2): an arbitrary number of scans is supported --
//     DC first scan and DC refinement scans (interleaved or
//     non-interleaved), AC first scans (spectral selection, one
//     component per scan, with end-of-band run coding), and AC
//     refinement scans (successive approximation, with correction bits
//     and ZRL) -- see decodeProgressiveScan and its helpers below.
//   - Restart markers (DRI/RSTn) are supported for both baseline and
//     progressive scans: DC predictors and (for progressive AC scans)
//     the end-of-band run counter reset, and the entropy bitstream
//     re-aligns to a byte boundary, at each restart interval boundary
//     (ITU-T T.81 B.1.1.5 Note 1 for the byte-alignment padding
//     convention; G.1.2.2's EOBRUN text and F.2.4.4/B.2.4.4 for restart
//     semantics generally).
// Anything outside that returns `{ ok: false }`, the same "recognized but
// not handled, degrade gracefully" shape LoadPCX/LoadTGA/decodePNG already
// use for their own out-of-spec inputs -- callers decide whether that's a
// soft failure (missing-asset fallback) or a hard error (Sys_Error),
// exactly like LoadPNG's existing `reason.startsWith("unsupported")` check
// in gl_image.ts (this decoder's "unsupported" reasons are written to be
// caught by the identical check).
//
// Algorithm notes (all hand-rolled per PORTING.md's "no external
// dependencies" rule -- png.ts's own hand-rolled inflate is the
// precedent; this file has no zlib-equivalent shortcut available since
// node:zlib doesn't do JPEG):
//   - Huffman decode uses the canonical BITS/HUFFVAL table-building
//     procedure from ITU-T T.81 Annex C.2 (generate_size_table /
//     generate_code_table) and the mincode/maxcode/valptr DECODE
//     procedure from Annex F.2.2.3 -- the standard, well-documented
//     approach, not a from-scratch design.
//   - The inverse DCT is the direct separable (row-pass then
//     column-pass) formulation of Annex A's IDCT formula: O(8^3) per
//     block via two 8x8 matrix multiplies against a precomputed cosine
//     basis, rather than a naive O(8^4) double sum. Not a fast
//     (AAN/Loeffler) IDCT -- correctness and readability over raw speed,
//     matching png.ts's own "hand-rolled, not hand-optimized" precedent.
//   - Chroma upsampling is nearest-neighbor (box replication): each
//     subsampled plane sample is read back via
//     `floor(fullResCoord * samplingFactor / maxSamplingFactor)`, the
//     simplest correct baseline reconstruction (real decoders often use
//     smarter interpolation, but nothing in the JPEG spec requires it).
//   - YCbCr->RGB uses the standard ITU-R BT.601 full-range JFIF formula.
//
// Progressive (SOF2) decoding model (ITU-T T.81 Annex G -- "Progressive
// DCT-based mode of operation"; Annex G.2 states decoder operation
// explicitly: "Decoder operation is defined by reversing the function of
// each step described in the encoder flow charts [Figures G.3-G.11], and
// performing the steps in reverse order" -- there are no decoder-side
// flowcharts in the spec for this mode, only encoder ones, by design):
//   - Unlike baseline's single scan that goes straight from Huffman-coded
//     bits to dequantized-and-IDCT'd pixels per block (decodeBlockInto),
//     a progressive frame spreads each block's 64 DCT coefficients across
//     many scans: a DC first scan plus zero or more DC refinement scans
//     (Ss=Se=0), and one AC first scan plus zero or more AC refinement
//     scans per contiguous spectral band (1<=Ss<=Se<=63) per component
//     (ITU-T T.81 A.4, G.1.1.1.1). This file accumulates each component's
//     raw (pre-dequantization) coefficient levels into a persistent
//     Int32Array (Component.coeffs, one 64-entry natural-order block per
//     entry, allocated once per component when SOF2 is parsed) that scans
//     progressively fill in and refine; only after every scan has been
//     processed does finalizeProgressive dequantize (ITU-T T.81 A.3.4)
//     and run the coefficients through the SAME idct8x8/pixel-store logic
//     baseline uses, so the existing dequant/IDCT/upsample/color-convert
//     stages are unchanged -- progressive decoding differs only in how
//     the 64 coefficients per block are assembled before that point.
//   - Successive approximation (ITU-T T.81 A.4, B.2.3's Ah/Al fields):
//     each scan of a spectral band codes coefficients at a fixed bit
//     position Al, refining a lower-precision version coded in an earlier
//     scan (Ah = the Al of the previous scan of that band; Ah=0 means
//     "first scan of this band"). The DC point transform is an
//     arithmetic shift right by Al at the encoder / a shift left by Al at
//     the decoder (A.4); the AC point transform is an integer divide by
//     2^Al at the encoder / a rescale by 2^Al at the decoder. This file
//     applies that rescale at the moment a coefficient is first written
//     (`<< al`) and applies later refinement scans as direct additions of
//     +-2^Al (DC: a single OR'd-in bit at position Al; AC: correction
//     bits per G.1.2.3, see below) -- so by the time finalizeProgressive
//     runs, every stored coefficient is already at full (Al=0) scale and
//     dequantization proceeds exactly like the baseline path's.
//   - DC coefficient decoding (ITU-T T.81 G.1.2.1): the first DC scan for
//     a component (Ah=0) is decoded exactly like baseline's DC coding
//     (F.2.2.1 EXTEND over a Huffman-coded magnitude category, added to a
//     running per-component predictor reset at each scan/restart), then
//     left-shifted by Al. A DC refinement scan (Ah!=0) carries no Huffman
//     coding at all -- G.1.2.1: "the least significant bits are appended
//     to the compressed bit stream without compression or modification"
//     -- so the decoder just reads one raw bit per block and ORs it into
//     the coefficient at bit position Al.
//   - AC first-scan decoding (ITU-T T.81 G.1.2.2, Table G.1, Figure G.2):
//     within a spectral band [Ss,Se], coefficients are decoded with the
//     same RRRRSSSS composite Huffman code as baseline AC decoding
//     (F.2.2.2), except the all-zero "EOB" code point is replaced by 15
//     EOBn codes (RRRR=0..14, SSSS=0) that each mean "the current block's
//     remaining band is zero, and so are the next N-1 blocks' entire
//     bands" -- Table G.1 gives the run length per EOBn (EOBn's range is
//     2^RRRR .. 2^(RRRR+1)-1, with RRRR extra bits selecting the exact
//     value, mirroring EXTEND's category encoding); RRRR=15,SSSS=0 (ZRL)
//     still means "16 zero coefficients" as in baseline. The end-of-band
//     run counter (EOBRUN) persists across blocks within a scan and is
//     reset to zero at the start of the scan and at each restart interval
//     (Table G.1's text, mirroring F.2.4.4/B.2.4.4's restart semantics).
//   - AC refinement-scan decoding (ITU-T T.81 G.1.2.3, Figures G.7-G.9,
//     reversed per G.2): this is the trickiest part of progressive JPEG.
//     Within a block's band, existing (non-zero-history) coefficients
//     each carry one "correction" bit (rule b, T.81 page 125): a 1-bit
//     means "add 2^Al to the coefficient's magnitude" (sign preserved).
//     RRRR in a composite code counts *zero-history* coefficients only,
//     skipping over (but still correcting) any non-zero-history
//     coefficients encountered along the way (T.81 page 124-125,
//     G.1.2.3's intro text) -- this file's inner skip loop in
//     decodeACRefineBlock implements exactly that rule. A composite code
//     with SSSS=1 introduces a newly non-zero coefficient of magnitude
//     2^Al with one sign bit following (rule a); ZRL (RRRR=15, SSSS=0)
//     skips exactly 16 zero-history coefficients (correcting any
//     non-zero-history ones passed over) without placing a value, and --
//     since RRRR can only directly express 0-15 -- longer zero-history
//     runs are ZRL-chained exactly like baseline/AC-first coding. An
//     EOBn code (SSSS=0, RRRR<15) sets EOBRUN and means "the rest of this
//     block's band, and the next EOBRUN-1 blocks' entire bands, get
//     correction bits only (no new coefficients)"; while EOBRUN>0, each
//     subsequent block in the scan applies correction bits to its
//     existing non-zero coefficients across the whole band and then
//     decrements EOBRUN, with no Huffman codes read for that block at
//     all.
//   - Interleaving (ITU-T T.81 clause 4.10, G.1.1.1.1): only DC scans may
//     interleave more than one component (decoded MCU-by-MCU exactly
//     like baseline); AC scans are always single-component
//     ("non-interleaved"), decoded in the component's own block-raster
//     order (A.2.2) rather than MCU order. A non-interleaved scan's block
//     grid is the *tight* grid derived straight from that component's own
//     sample dimensions (A.1.1: xi=ceil(X*Hi/Hmax), yi=ceil(Y*Vi/Vmax),
//     then ceil(./8) blocks each way) -- NOT the MCU-padded grid
//     (mcusPerLine*Hi etc.) baseline/interleaved-DC scans use, since
//     A.2.4's "extend to a whole number of blocks per Hi/Vi" padding rule
//     is explicitly conditioned on "if the component is to be
//     interleaved". The coefficient buffer itself is always sized to the
//     MCU-padded grid, though (that's what the DC scan already
//     allocated) -- so non-interleaved scans iterate the tight grid's
//     block *count* but still address the padded grid's *stride* when
//     computing each block's offset into Component.coeffs. Getting this
//     wrong is a classic progressive-decoder bug for subsampled (e.g.
//     4:2:0) images whose dimensions aren't exact multiples of 16;
//     Component.tightBlocksPerLine/tightBlocksPerColumn (loop bounds) vs
//     Component.coeffBlocksPerLine/coeffBlocksPerColumn (buffer stride,
//     also the plane dimensions) keep the two apart.
//   - Restart interval semantics (ITU-T T.81 B.2.4.4, clause 4.8.2): Ri
//     counts MCUs, and clause 4.8.2 defines "for non-interleaved data the
//     MCU is one data unit" -- so for a non-interleaved (AC, or
//     single-component DC) scan, Ri directly counts 8x8 blocks, exactly
//     like this file's restart-countdown loop already does for both scan
//     shapes.

// (RRRR=15, SSSS=0) skips zero-history coefficients the same way a
// value-placing code does, just with RRRR's literal decoded value (15,
// not 16) and no value placed at the position that resolves it -- since a
// single composite code's RRRR can only directly express 0-15, longer
// zero-history runs chain ZRLs exactly like baseline/AC-first coding. An

// coefficients are already non-zero, once those are corrected. Either
// way, resolution happens by unconditionally advancing one more position
// (this is what lets a lone value-placing/ZRL code and a following run of
// already-non-zero corrections share one composite code, and is also why
// RRRR's skip count for ZRL is 15 rather than 16 -- the 16th zero-history
// position is consumed by that same unconditional advance, not by an
// extra decrement): the very next Huffman code is always read immediately
// after, before any further already-non-zero corrections past that point
